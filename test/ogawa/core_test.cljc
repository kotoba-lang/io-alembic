  "Bytes laid out by hand from the upstream spec, NOT by this library's writer.

  The layout is deliberately one the writer never produces: the root group sits
  immediately after the header and its data child comes afterwards, whereas
  `write-archive` emits children before their parent because it cannot record
  a child's position until the child exists. A reader that only ever sees its
  own writer's output agrees with itself; this fixture is what makes the
  agreement be with Alembic instead.
