  "The Alembic property and sample layer: what an object actually holds.

  `alembic.objects` answers \"what objects are in this file\". This answers
  \"what is in an object\" and \"what are the numbers\" — the point at which a
  `.abc` stops being an inventory and becomes geometry.

  Like the two layers below it, the layout is TRANSCRIBED rather than inferred,
  from `alembic/alembic` `lib/Alembic/AbcCoreOgawa`, read 2026-08-24:

      compound property group (CprData.cpp)
        0..n-2  GROUP    one per property header, in header order
        n-1     data     the packed property headers
        (a compound with no properties has zero children, and a group whose
         last child is not data is not a property group at all)

      packed property headers (ReadUtil.cpp `ReadPropertyHeaders`)
        uint32 info, then fields whose WIDTH DEPENDS ON `info`:

          info & 0x0003        0 compound, 1 scalar, 2 array
                               (bit 0 also means \"scalar-like\")
          (info & 0x000c) >> 2 size hint: 0 -> uint8, 1 -> uint16, 2 -> uint32.
                               **Every length below is read at this width.**
                               Reading them all as uint32 walks off the end of
                               a small header and invents properties.
          (info & 0x00f0) >> 4 POD type (non-compound only)
          info & 0x0100        a time sampling index follows
          info & 0x0200        first/last changed indices follow
          info & 0x0400        the sample size varies (not homogenous)
          info & 0x0800        the value is the same over all samples
          (info & 0xff000) >> 12    extent — components per element
          (info & 0xff00000) >> 20  metadata index, 0xff meaning inline

        non-compound, in order: nextSampleIndex, then (if 0x0200) firstChanged
        and lastChanged, then (if 0x0100) timeSamplingIndex — all at hint width.
        Then, for every kind: nameSize + name, and if the metadata index is
        0xff, metaDataSize + metadata.

        When 0x0200 is absent the changed range is IMPLIED, and the two cases
        differ: with 0x0800 it is [0,0] (constant), otherwise
        [1, nextSampleIndex-1]. Defaulting to [0,0] would make every animated
        property read as constant — the first sample is right, so the mistake
        looks like \"the cache is not animating\" rather than like a parse bug.

      sample storage
        scalar (SprImpl.cpp)   child `i` of the property group is the data for
                               stored sample i
        array  (AprImpl.cpp)   child `2i` is the data, child `2i+1` the
                               dimensions

      every sample data block (ReadUtil.cpp `ReadData`)
        the FIRST 16 BYTES ARE A KEY (a hash) and are not values. A block
        smaller than 16 bytes holds nothing.

      dimensions (ReadUtil.cpp `ReadDimensions`)
        an empty dims block means rank 1, and the count is derived:
        (dataSize - 16) / bytes-per-element. Otherwise the block is
        uint64 per rank.

      stored index (ReadUtil.h `verifyIndex`)
        i < firstChanged                     -> 0
        firstChanged == lastChanged == 0     -> 0   (constant)
        i >= lastChanged                     -> lastChanged - firstChanged + 1
        otherwise                            -> i - firstChanged + 1

  **What this does not do.** String and wstring PODs are recognised but their
  samples are refused, not guessed: `ReadData` splits them on NUL and the
  wstring path has a width this implementation has not verified. Float16 is
  refused for the same reason — the half decode was not transcribed. Refusing
  is deliberate: a wrong number that arrives looks exactly like a right one,
  and a caller cannot tell. Schema interpretation (that `P` on a PolyMesh is
  the point list, that `.faceIndices` winds a particular way) is NOT here
  either — this returns named, typed arrays, and `AbcGeom` is the layer that
  would say what the names mean."
